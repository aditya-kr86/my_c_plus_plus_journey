/*
# What is STL?
- STL (Standard Template Library) is a collection of generic classes and functions for efficient programming.
- It is widely used in competitive programming to save time by providing pre-implemented data structures and algorithms.

# Why Use STL?
- Avoids reinventing the wheel – Use pre-built components instead of writing everything from scratch.
- Improves efficiency in coding contests and interviews.
- Reduces development time while ensuring reliability.- 

# Components of STL
- Containers – Store data (e.g., vector, list, map).
- Algorithms – Manipulate data (e.g., sort(), search(), reverse()).
- Iterators – Access and traverse data (similar to pointers).- 

# How STL Works?
- Iterators connect algorithms to containers for efficient data manipulation.
- Example: Sorting a container using sort() and iterators.
