/*
## Inheritance in C++
1. Definition:
- Mechanism of creating new classes (derived) from existing classes (base).
- Promotes reusability and extensibility.

2. Types:
- Single: One derived class inherits one base class.
- Multiple: One derived class inherits multiple base classes.
- Hierarchical: Multiple derived classes inherit one base class.
- Multilevel: A derived class inherits another derived class.
- Hybrid: Combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance.

3. Example:
    class Base {
        // Base class code
    };
    class Derived : public Base {
        // Derived class inherits Base
    };

4. Key Benefits:
- Saves time and cost.
- Ensures reusability of tested and debugged code.
- Facilitates scalability.
