/*
# What Are Containers?
- Containers are objects that store data in different ways.

Three types of containers in STL:
✔ Sequence Containers – Linear storage (e.g., vector, list).
✔ Associative Containers – Fast search using key-value pairs (e.g., map, set).
✔ Derived Containers – Specialized operations (e.g., stack, queue).

# Key Properties of Containers

✔ Vector: Fast random access, slow insertion/deletion except at the end.
✔ List: Slow random access, fast insertion/deletion at any position.
✔ Set/Map: Fast search and retrieval, but no random access.
✔ Stack: LIFO (Last In, First Out) – Used for undo operations.
✔ Queue: FIFO (First In, First Out) – Used for processing tasks in order.
